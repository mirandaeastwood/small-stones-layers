<p>Kaie Kellough, Kevin Yuen Kit Lo, and Jason Sharp have created this stunning audio-visual experience, "Small Stones," hosted on SpokenWeb's Archive of the Present. The following annotations are a gesture towards identifying the ways in which the audio layers of this piece interact, intersect, and intercede one another from the perspective of sound design and audio layering.</p>
 
 <p>Please note that these annotations focus on the auditory layers of the work only; the visual/textual aspects are not presently reflected in this project.</p>
